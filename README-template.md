### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Css variable font

### What I learned

i learned the difference between child and descendant selectors. I utilized the nth child selector in this project. I also learnt how to wrap up an element in a circle. I also learnt how to load variable fonts locally using @fontface.

```css
.subjects > :nth-child(2) {
  color: hsla(39, 100%, 56%);
  background: hsla(39, 100%, 56%, var(--opacity));
}
```

### Continued development

I'm not completely comfortable with the variations that can be achieved when using variable font declarations. There a lot of css properties related to this that i don't yet understand. I will take a deeper look as i build future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/259-how-to-use-variable-fonts/) - This helped me understand variable fonts in css.
